      <h2>Understanding Brick Veneer: What You Need to Know</h2>

      <p>Making informed decisions about your property starts with understanding how brick veneer works, how it differs from other construction methods, and what to expect from your installation.</p>

      <h3>Benefits of Brick Veneer Installation</h3>

      <p>Brick veneer offers homeowners and commercial property owners significant advantages that make it one of the most popular exterior finish choices:</p>

      <p><strong>Durability & Longevity</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>50-100+ year lifespan with proper maintenance</li>
        <li>Excellent resistance to harsh weather, including freeze-thaw cycles</li>
        <li>Won't rot, warp, or deteriorate like wood siding</li>
        <li>Resists insect damage and mold growth</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Low Maintenance Requirements</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No painting or staining required</li>
        <li>Minimal cleaning needs (occasional washing)</li>
        <li>Infrequent repointing (every 20-30 years typically)</li>
        <li>Color never fades or requires refreshing</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides thermal mass that moderates temperature swings</li>
        <li>Air cavity allows for full-thickness modern insulation</li>
        <li>Reduces heating and cooling costs</li>
        <li>Blocks wind infiltration better than many siding materials</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Fire Resistance</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brick is a non-combustible material</li>
        <li>Provides superior fire protection compared to vinyl or wood siding</li>
        <li>May qualify for insurance discounts in some areas</li>
        <li>Creates a fire barrier between exterior and structural walls</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Weather Protection</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent resistance to rain, snow, and wind</li>
        <li>Protects underlying structure from moisture damage</li>
        <li>Cavity wall design allows water drainage</li>
        <li>Resists impact from hail and debris</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common Brick Veneer Problems</h3>

      <p>
        While brick veneer is exceptionally durable, certain issues can develop over time—especially in climates with significant freeze-thaw cycles, heavy precipitation, or foundation movement.
        Recognizing these problems early allows for timely repairs that prevent more extensive damage:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Cracked Bricks</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Foundation settlement, thermal expansion/contraction, impact damage, or excessive moisture</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Visible cracks running through individual bricks, often in a stair-step pattern</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Water infiltration, accelerated deterioration, structural concerns if widespread</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional assessment to determine cause, crack repair or brick replacement as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Spalling Brick</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Water absorption followed by freeze-thaw cycles causing surface layer to flake off</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Brick surfaces peeling, flaking, or popping off; rough, deteriorated appearance</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Progressive damage that worsens each winter; structural weakening</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace severely spalled bricks; improve drainage to prevent moisture accumulation</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Deteriorating Mortar Joints</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Age, weathering, incorrect mortar mix, or excessive moisture exposure</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Crumbling mortar, gaps in joints, mortar easily scraped away with a tool</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Water infiltration behind brick veneer; loose bricks; potential wall failure</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional tuckpointing to remove deteriorated mortar and install fresh mortar</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Efflorescence (White Staining)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Water-soluble salts migrating through brick and crystallizing on surface</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> White, powdery deposits on brick surface; often appears after rain</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Primarily aesthetic but indicates water infiltration issues</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Clean deposits; identify and fix water source; improve drainage</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Bulging or Bowing Walls</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Failed wall ties, structural movement, excessive moisture, or freeze-thaw pressure</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Visible outward movement of brick veneer; gaps between brick and structure</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Serious safety hazard; risk of collapse if not addressed</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Emergency professional assessment; structural repairs; wall tie replacement</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Water Stains and Dampness</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Failed flashing, clogged weep holes, deteriorated mortar, or poor drainage</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Dark staining on brick; water marks on interior walls behind brick</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Interior water damage; mold growth; structural deterioration</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Identify water entry point; repair flashing; clear drainage; seal as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Gaps Between Brick and Structure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Foundation settlement, structural movement, or failed wall ties</li>
        <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Visible separation between brick veneer and building; cracks at corners</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Loss of structural connection; increased risk of wall failure</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional structural assessment; wall tie repair or replacement</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>When to Call a Professional:</strong> If you notice any of these warning signs, contact Tibben Masonry for a thorough assessment. Early detection and professional repair prevent minor
        issues from becoming major structural problems that compromise your home's safety and value.
