      <!-- WHY CHOOSE CMU BLOCK - EDUCATIONAL CONTENT -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Choose Concrete Block Masonry?</h2>

        <p>
          Concrete masonry units offer distinct advantages for foundation and structural applications throughout Eastern Ontario's climate conditions. Understanding these benefits helps homeowners and
          contractors make informed construction decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>Structural Strength</h3>
        <p>
          CMU blocks provide exceptional load-bearing capacity with compressive strengths between 600-1500 PSI. When properly reinforced with steel rebar and grout-filled cores, concrete block
          foundations deliver reliable structural performance for decades.
        </p>

        <h3>Fire Resistance</h3>
        <p>Concrete masonry units are non-combustible and provide fire ratings up to 4 hours, protecting your property and meeting insurance requirements for commercial structures.</p>

        <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p>When combined with proper insulation, CMU walls offer excellent thermal mass properties that regulate indoor temperatures and reduce heating costs in Ontario's cold climate.</p>

        <h3>Cost-Effective Construction</h3>
        <p>
          Concrete block construction typically costs less than poured concrete foundations while providing comparable structural performance. The modular nature speeds installation and reduces labor
          costs.
        </p>

        <h3>Durability & Longevity</h3>
        <p>Properly constructed CMU walls resist moisture, pests, mold, and weathering. With minimal maintenance, concrete block foundations last 50-100+ years.</p>

        <h3>Design Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          Available in multiple sizes (4", 6", 8", 10", 12" widths) and finishes, concrete masonry units accommodate various architectural and structural requirements from residential basements to
          commercial facades.
        </p>

      <!-- FAQ SECTION - TARGETS LONG-TAIL KEYWORDS -->
      <section class="faq">
        <h2>Concrete Block Foundation FAQs</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long do concrete block foundations last?</h3>
          <p>
            Properly constructed CMU foundations with appropriate waterproofing and drainage typically last 50-100+ years with minimal maintenance. The key factors are quality installation, proper
            reinforcement, effective moisture management, and regular inspection for minor issues before they become major problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Are concrete block foundations strong enough for 2-story homes?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. When engineered with proper reinforcement (steel rebar and grout-filled cores), CMU foundations easily support multi-story residential structures. Block foundations are commonly used
            for 2-story and even 3-story buildings throughout Ontario. Load-bearing capacity depends on block type, wall thickness, and reinforcement specifications meeting engineering requirements.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do concrete block basements leak more than poured concrete?</h3>
          <p>
            Not when properly constructed. Both foundation types perform equally well with appropriate waterproofing systems and drainage. Block foundation waterproofing requires attention to mortar
            joints and surface preparation. Tibben Masonry applies proven waterproofing techniques specific to CMU construction, including damp-proofing coatings, exterior membranes, and proper
            drainage tile installation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can you insulate concrete block foundations?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Several effective insulation methods exist for CMU foundations including rigid foam boards applied to exterior (before backfill) or interior walls, spray foam insulation, insulated
            block products, and finished basement wall systems with built-in insulation. We recommend insulation strategies meeting Ontario Building Code energy efficiency requirements.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How thick should concrete block foundation walls be?</h3>
          <p>
            Most residential basements use 8" thick CMU blocks (actual dimension 7-5/8"). Taller walls, heavy loads, or poor soil conditions may require 10" or 12" blocks. Engineering calculations
            determine appropriate wall thickness based on your specific project requirements, soil bearing capacity, and building loads.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the difference between CMU blocks and cinder blocks?</h3>
          <p>
            "Cinder blocks" is an outdated term for concrete blocks originally made with cinder aggregate. Modern concrete masonry units (CMUs) use stone, sand, and gravel aggregates producing
            stronger, more consistent blocks. The terms are often used interchangeably, but CMU is the proper industry terminology for structural concrete blocks meeting ASTM standards.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can concrete block foundations be repaired if damaged?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. CMU foundations offer repair advantages because individual blocks can be replaced, unlike monolithic poured walls. Common repairs include crack filling, mortar repointing, partial
            wall rebuilding, and reinforcement additions. Tibben Masonry provides foundation repair services for cracked, bowing, or deteriorating concrete block walls throughout our service area.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How deep do concrete block foundations need to be in Ontario?</h3>
          <p>
            Ontario Building Code requires foundation footings extend below the frost line to prevent frost heaving. In Eastern Ontario, the frost line ranges from 4 to 6 feet depending on specific
            location. Most residential basements excavate 8-9 feet deep to accommodate footings below frost line plus standard 8-foot basement ceiling height.
