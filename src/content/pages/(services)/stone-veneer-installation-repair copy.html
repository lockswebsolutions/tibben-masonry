      <!-- Natural vs Manufactured Comparison -->
      <h2>Natural vs Manufactured: Making the Right Choice</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important decisions in your stone veneer project is choosing between natural stone and manufactured stone veneer. Both options offer distinct advantages depending on your
        project goals, budget, and specific application. Understanding the key differences helps you make an informed decision that balances aesthetics, performance, and cost.

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Quick Decision Guide:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Choose <strong>Natural Stone Veneer</strong> for: Exteriors exposed to harsh weather, projects prioritizing authenticity and longevity, high-end residential and commercial applications, and
          situations requiring pressure washing maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose <strong>Manufactured Stone Veneer</strong> for: Interior accent walls, budget-conscious projects, large surface areas requiring pattern consistency, lightweight substrate
          applications, and areas where color uniformity is important.

        Masonry apart as Eastern Ontario's trusted specialists:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Thorough inspection at every stage to ensure long-term performance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stone Matching Expertise for Repairs and Additions</h3>
      <p>Repairing or adding to existing stone veneer requires expert stone matching skills that only come with decades of experience. Our stone matching capabilities include:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Custom color matching techniques for manufactured stone veneer</li>
        <li>Understanding of how different quarries produce variations in natural stone</li>
        <li>Ability to blend new and existing stone for seamless visual integration</li>
        <li>Knowledge of historical stone types used in Eastern Ontario architecture</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bonded & Insured for Your Protection</h3>
      <p>Tibben Masonry carries comprehensive liability insurance and bonding to protect your property, your investment, and our team members. This professional coverage provides you with:</p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Understanding Stone Veneer: Benefits, Cost, and What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        Making informed decisions about your stone veneer project starts with understanding how stone veneer works, its advantages over other materials, and what factors affect cost and performance in
        Eastern Ontario's climate.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits of Installation</h3>
      <p>Stone veneer offers homeowners and commercial property owners significant advantages that make it one of the most desirable exterior and interior finish choices:</p>

      <p><strong>Project Complexity Factors:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface Area:</strong> Larger projects benefit from volume pricing</li>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> Multi-story installations require scaffolding and safety equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Architectural Details:</strong> Windows, doors, corners, and custom features increase labor time</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Complexity:</strong> Custom designs, mixed materials, or intricate patterns require additional labor</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Difficult site access may increase installation time and cost</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Substrate Preparation Requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removal of existing siding or finishes</li>
        <li>Installation of weather-resistant barrier (WRB)</li>
        <li>Metal lath and scratch coat application</li>
        <li>Structural reinforcement if needed for heavier natural stone</li>
        <li>Flashing installation around openings</li>
      </ul>

          <strong>Cost vs. Value Consideration:</strong> While natural stone veneer costs more upfront, it never requires replacement, never fades, and lasts 50-100+ years. Manufactured stone veneer
          offers lower initial cost but may require replacement after 30-50 years and can experience color fading. When calculated over the building's lifetime, natural stone often provides better
          value despite higher installation cost.
